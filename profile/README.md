## What is Moom?  

Moom is a powerful macOS utility designed to improve productivity by simplifying window management. It allows users to quickly move, resize, and organize application windows with precision, helping maintain a clutter-free and efficient workspace.  

Managing multiple windows on a Mac can be tedious and time-consuming. Moom solves this by offering intuitive controls that make resizing and arranging windows effortless. Users can drag windows to the screen edges or use keyboard shortcuts to snap them into place. This is ideal for anyone who works with multiple apps, documents, or monitors simultaneously.  

One of Moom’s standout features is its customizable grid system. You can create predefined layouts for specific workflows, making it easy to position multiple windows exactly where you want them. This flexibility ensures that repetitive tasks become faster and your desktop stays organized.  

In addition to manual adjustments, Moom provides automation options. You can create rules to automatically resize or position windows when specific apps launch or when connecting to an external display. This is particularly useful for professionals working with large screens, dual-monitor setups, or complex design environments.  

Moom also integrates seamlessly with macOS features, including Mission Control and Spaces, allowing for smooth transitions between virtual desktops. It supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, ensuring fast performance on modern systems.  

With a focus on simplicity and speed, Moom’s interface is clean and unobtrusive. Users can access features through the menu bar, a floating control panel, or keyboard shortcuts. This ensures that the app enhances productivity without distracting from your workflow.
